1.  Q1 and Q2 contain the files phil.c and multi_pc.c respectively.
2.  Run them in windows only. I came to know that the codes are working fine in windows 
    but not in linux or ubuntu.
3.  Commands for running :
        i)  gcc -o phil phil.c
        ii) ./phil N    -> where N is the number of philosophers.

        i)  gcc -o multi_pc multi_pc.came
        ii) ./multi_pc -p p -pc pc -c c -cc cc      -> where p is the number of producers.
                                                    -> where pc is the number of items to be produced.
                                                    -> where c is the number of consumers.
                                                    -> where cc is the number of items to be consumed.
