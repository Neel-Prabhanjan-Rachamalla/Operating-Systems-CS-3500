Report :

When the first round of producers have been kept to sleep by 5 seconds , the first set 
production gets delayed by 5 seconds. By then since the stack is empty the consumers
remain idle until atleast one producer produces. So , the result wont change much but
the whole process gets delayed by 5 seconds.
